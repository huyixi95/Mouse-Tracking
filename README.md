# Mouse-Tracking
This is a C++ implementation of mouse tracking project by using OpenCV and mfc framework

Overview
I do this project for realizing the function tracking a lighting point like PS MOVE using OpenCV, MFC framework and a usb uvc camera which
is at least 30 FPS if you want a pretty usage experience.

It denpends on OpenCV, MFC and visual studio, so you have to install them first.And of course, it runs in the Windows Environment.That's
why I upload a VS project.

Now I use ASMS[1] algorithm for tracking function from the vojirt repo.(https://github.com/vojirt/asms)

This algorithm is belong to the author of Tomas Vojir, Jana Noskova, Jiri Matas.
